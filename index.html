Open `index.html` in your text editor (the in-browser IDE). Add a `doctype` tag at the top of the
file indicating that the rest of the file will be HTML code. Then create
opening and closing `html` tags to enclose the remainder of your page's
content. Add opening and closing `head` and `body` tags within the outer
`html` tags to break your HTML document up into two sections. Remember, the
`head` section generally contains data intended for the web browser, and the
`body` section contains the content our users will see and interact with on the
page.

Then add a `title` within the `head` and make sure that it isn't blank.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file
before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error
messages that you can use to debug your code â€” read them closely for hints!

## Viewing your work in the browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal to check your work.
