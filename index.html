<!-- Write your HTML in this file -->


<!doctype html>



Open `index.html` in your text editor (the in-browser IDE). Add a `doctype` tag at the top of the
file indicating that the rest of the file will be HTML code. Then create
opening and closing `html` tags to enclose the remainder of your page's
content. Add opening and closing `head` and `body` tags within the outer
`html` tags to break your HTML document up into two sections. Remember, the
`head` section generally contains data intended for the web browser, and the
`body` section contains the content our users will see and interact with on the
page.
